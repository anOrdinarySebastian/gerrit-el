* Development

** TODO Make emacs fetch the current refspec
This should also be able to use a universal argument to give it as a string
** DONE Make emacs go to the correct line and insert comments
Maybe take inspiration from smerge or flyspell or someting like *org
babel* Would be bonkers if the latter could be done as a render. Then
the formatting would be retained while simultaneously showing comments
that do not insert into the code. Hopefully?

* Feature growth

** Investigate if it is possible to get a more basic return JSON
This would reduce the need for local handling

** Add possibility to write comments in Emacs and upload

** Handle file comments
Currently I'm only going to look for actual file numbers, don't know
how file comments will be handled
