* Development

** TODO Make emacs fetch the current refspec
This should also be able to use a universal argument to give it as a string
** TODO Make emacs go to the corret line and insert comments
Maybe take inspiration from smerge or flyspell or someting like *org
babel* Would be bonkers if the latter could be done as a render. Then
the formatting would be retained while simultaneously showing comments
that do not insert into the code. Hopefully?

* Feature growth

** Investigate if it is possible to get a more basic return JSON
This would reduce the need for local handling

** Add possibility to write comments in Emacs and upload
